    # Roman Candle (9)
    "He played himself
Didn't need me to give him hell
He could be cool and cruel to you and me
Knew we'd put up with anything
I wanna hurt him
I wanna give him pain
I'm a Roman candle
My head is full of flames
I'm hallucinating, hallucinating
I hear you cry
Your tears are cheap
Wet hot red swollen cheeks
Fall asleep
I wanna hurt him
I wanna give him pain
I'm a Roman candle
My head is full of flames
I wanna hurt him
I wanna hurt him
I wanna hurt him
I wanna give him pain
Make him feel this pretty burn",
    "She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
She locked the car and slipped past into rhythmic quietude
Lights burning, voice dry and hoarse
I threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth
The chimes fell over each other, I fell onto my knees
The sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased
A sick shouting like you hear at the fairground
Now i'm picking up to put away anything of yours that's still around
I don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters
It'll make a whisper outta you
She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
The fairgrounds lit
A drunk man sits by the gate she's driving through
Got his hat tipped bottle back in between his teeth
Looks like he's buried in the sand at the beach
I can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake
To take a little nap while the road is straight
I wish that car had never been discovered
They took away the bottle and the hat he was under
That's the one thing he could do
And it'll make a whisper outta you
She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
Cops were running around the scene looking for some kind of clue
They never get uptight when a moth gets crushed
Unless a lightbulb really loved him very much
I'm lying down, blowing smoke from my cigarette
Little whisper smoke signs that you'll never get
You're in your Oldsmobile driving by the moon
Headlights burning bright ahead of you
And someone's burning out out on Condor Avenue
Trying to make a whisper outta you
What a shitty thing to say, did you really mean it?
You never said a word to me about what passed between us
So now i'm leaving you alone
You can do whatever the hell you want to
Na na na na na na",
    "At a party
He was waiting
Looking kind of spooky and withdrawn
Like he could be underwater
The mighty mother with her hundred arms
Swept all aside
I hate to walk behind other people's ambition
I saw you waiting
Saint-like
With your warning
Leave alone
You don't belong here
He got nervous
Started whistling
Every thought a ricochet
Did you notice?
Well I wondered
What's the worst thing I could say?
Froze up and sighed
You remind me of someone's daughter
I forgot her
I forgot her name, ashamed
Go home
And live with your pain
Leave alone
Leave alone, 'cause you know you don't belong
You don't belong here
And when I go
Don't you follow
Leave alone
Leave alone, 'cause you know you don't belong
You don't belong here
Slip out quiet
Nobody's looking
Leave alone
You don't belong here",
    "Concrete hands picked up the telephone ring
Do you know who you're talking to?
No, and I don't care who
She whispered quiet terror news
He didn't give a hoot
Said do what you have to do
All she had to do was speak
Mouthpiece to cheek
Please say no more
I'm lying here on the ground
A strip of wet concrete
Her name was just a broken sound
A struffle step you hear when you're falling down
Killing time won't stop this crying
Killing time won't stop this crying
Killing time won't stop this crying
You better start watching what message that you send now
No more situations I only go in to be kicked out
He got knocked down leaning like he ran into a clothesline
And remembered a couple of words that hid a crime
You're just fine
You'll be just fine
But I'm on the other line
Killing time won't stop this crying
Killing time won't stop this crying
Killing time won't stop this crying",
    "We arrived too late
Our mouths were opening
I turned off the light
So, come on, night
You're a witness, you
You've seen me interrupt
A good, old-fashioned fight
So, come on, night
Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Watched the dying day
Blushing in the sky
Everyone is uptight
So, come on, night
Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
I know we're not
Illegitimate
In our hearing
So, come on
So, come on, night",
    "Two dollar color pictures from a photo booth
Dirty, stepped on, lying out on the floor of their room
Faces fell long in the half-light
He looks all wrong, but that's her alright
Look at him smiling full of teeth clenched tight
He knew the one time with the army captain
He got over that whole deal before it happened
And its okay I knew exactly what you meant
When you said you were an accident
When its three A.M. he wonders where in the hell she went
And he'll drive all over town
Drive all over town
And he'll drive all over town
Drive all over town
Until he tracks her down
He'll drive all over town",
    "For a change she got out before he hurt her bad
Took her records and clothes
And pictures of her boy
It really made her sad
Packed it up and didn't look back
I'm okay, let's just forget all about him
The car was cold and it smelled like old cigarettes and pine
In her bag I saw things she drew when she was nine
Like this one here
Her alone nobody near
What a shame lets just not talk about it
No, it doesn't look like you
But you did wear cowboy boots
That's your fame
There's no question about it
Once we got back inside
With one ear to the ground
I was ready to hide
'Cause I don't know who's around
And you look scared
It's our secret do not tell okay?
Let's just not talk about it
Don't tell, okay?
Let's just forget all about it",
    "Last call, he was sick of it all
Asleep at home
Told you off
And goodbye
Well, you know one day it'll come to haunt you
That you didn't tell him quite the truth
You're a crisis, you're an icicle
You're a tongue-less talker, you don't care what you say
You're a jaywalker and you just
Just walk away, and that's all you do
The clap of the fading-out sound of your shoes
Made him wonder who he thought that he knew
Trying to crawl under my skin
When I already shed my best defense
It comes out all around that you won
And I think I'm all done, you can switch me off safely
While I'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me
Yeah, yeah
You're still here but just check to make sure
All you aspired to do was endure
You can't ask for more, ask for more
Knowing you'll never get that which you ask for
So you cast your shadow everywhere like the man in the moon
And you start to drink, you just want to continue
It'll all be yesteryear soon
You start to drink, you just want to continue
It'll all be yesteryear soon
Church bells and now I'm awake
And I guess it must be some kind of holiday
I can't seem to join in the celebration
But I'll go to the service and I'll go to pray
And I'll sing the praises of my maker's name
Like I was as good as she made me
And I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me
