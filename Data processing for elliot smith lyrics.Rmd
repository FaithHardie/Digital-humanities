    # Roman Candle (9)
    "He played himself
Didn't need me to give him hell
He could be cool and cruel to you and me
Knew we'd put up with anything
I wanna hurt him
I wanna give him pain
I'm a Roman candle
My head is full of flames
I'm hallucinating, hallucinating
I hear you cry
Your tears are cheap
Wet hot red swollen cheeks
Fall asleep
I wanna hurt him
I wanna give him pain
I'm a Roman candle
My head is full of flames
I wanna hurt him
I wanna hurt him
I wanna hurt him
I wanna give him pain
Make him feel this pretty burn",
    "She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
She locked the car and slipped past into rhythmic quietude
Lights burning, voice dry and hoarse
I threw the screen door like a bastard back and forth
The chimes fell over each other, I fell onto my knees
The sound of the car driving off made me feel diseased
A sick shouting like you hear at the fairground
Now i'm picking up to put away anything of yours that's still around
I don't know what to do with your clothes or your letters
It'll make a whisper outta you
She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
The fairgrounds lit
A drunk man sits by the gate she's driving through
Got his hat tipped bottle back in between his teeth
Looks like he's buried in the sand at the beach
I can't think about you driving off to leave barely awake
To take a little nap while the road is straight
I wish that car had never been discovered
They took away the bottle and the hat he was under
That's the one thing he could do
And it'll make a whisper outta you
She took the Oldsmobile out past Condor Avenue
Cops were running around the scene looking for some kind of clue
They never get uptight when a moth gets crushed
Unless a lightbulb really loved him very much
I'm lying down, blowing smoke from my cigarette
Little whisper smoke signs that you'll never get
You're in your Oldsmobile driving by the moon
Headlights burning bright ahead of you
And someone's burning out out on Condor Avenue
Trying to make a whisper outta you
What a shitty thing to say, did you really mean it?
You never said a word to me about what passed between us
So now i'm leaving you alone
You can do whatever the hell you want to
Na na na na na na",
    "At a party
He was waiting
Looking kind of spooky and withdrawn
Like he could be underwater
The mighty mother with her hundred arms
Swept all aside
I hate to walk behind other people's ambition
I saw you waiting
Saint-like
With your warning
Leave alone
You don't belong here
He got nervous
Started whistling
Every thought a ricochet
Did you notice?
Well I wondered
What's the worst thing I could say?
Froze up and sighed
You remind me of someone's daughter
I forgot her
I forgot her name, ashamed
Go home
And live with your pain
Leave alone
Leave alone, 'cause you know you don't belong
You don't belong here
And when I go
Don't you follow
Leave alone
Leave alone, 'cause you know you don't belong
You don't belong here
Slip out quiet
Nobody's looking
Leave alone
You don't belong here",
    "Concrete hands picked up the telephone ring
Do you know who you're talking to?
No, and I don't care who
She whispered quiet terror news
He didn't give a hoot
Said do what you have to do
All she had to do was speak
Mouthpiece to cheek
Please say no more
I'm lying here on the ground
A strip of wet concrete
Her name was just a broken sound
A struffle step you hear when you're falling down
Killing time won't stop this crying
Killing time won't stop this crying
Killing time won't stop this crying
You better start watching what message that you send now
No more situations I only go in to be kicked out
He got knocked down leaning like he ran into a clothesline
And remembered a couple of words that hid a crime
You're just fine
You'll be just fine
But I'm on the other line
Killing time won't stop this crying
Killing time won't stop this crying
Killing time won't stop this crying",
    "We arrived too late
Our mouths were opening
I turned off the light
So, come on, night
You're a witness, you
You've seen me interrupt
A good, old-fashioned fight
So, come on, night
Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Watched the dying day
Blushing in the sky
Everyone is uptight
So, come on, night
Everyone is gone
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
Home to oblivion
I know we're not
Illegitimate
In our hearing
So, come on
So, come on, night",
    "Two dollar color pictures from a photo booth
Dirty, stepped on, lying out on the floor of their room
Faces fell long in the half-light
He looks all wrong, but that's her alright
Look at him smiling full of teeth clenched tight
He knew the one time with the army captain
He got over that whole deal before it happened
And its okay I knew exactly what you meant
When you said you were an accident
When its three A.M. he wonders where in the hell she went
And he'll drive all over town
Drive all over town
And he'll drive all over town
Drive all over town
Until he tracks her down
He'll drive all over town",
    "For a change she got out before he hurt her bad
Took her records and clothes
And pictures of her boy
It really made her sad
Packed it up and didn't look back
I'm okay, let's just forget all about him
The car was cold and it smelled like old cigarettes and pine
In her bag I saw things she drew when she was nine
Like this one here
Her alone nobody near
What a shame lets just not talk about it
No, it doesn't look like you
But you did wear cowboy boots
That's your fame
There's no question about it
Once we got back inside
With one ear to the ground
I was ready to hide
'Cause I don't know who's around
And you look scared
It's our secret do not tell okay?
Let's just not talk about it
Don't tell, okay?
Let's just forget all about it",
    "Last call, he was sick of it all
Asleep at home
Told you off
And goodbye
Well, you know one day it'll come to haunt you
That you didn't tell him quite the truth
You're a crisis, you're an icicle
You're a tongue-less talker, you don't care what you say
You're a jaywalker and you just
Just walk away, and that's all you do
The clap of the fading-out sound of your shoes
Made him wonder who he thought that he knew
Trying to crawl under my skin
When I already shed my best defense
It comes out all around that you won
And I think I'm all done, you can switch me off safely
While I'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me
Yeah, yeah
You're still here but just check to make sure
All you aspired to do was endure
You can't ask for more, ask for more
Knowing you'll never get that which you ask for
So you cast your shadow everywhere like the man in the moon
And you start to drink, you just want to continue
It'll all be yesteryear soon
You start to drink, you just want to continue
It'll all be yesteryear soon
Church bells and now I'm awake
And I guess it must be some kind of holiday
I can't seem to join in the celebration
But I'll go to the service and I'll go to pray
And I'll sing the praises of my maker's name
Like I was as good as she made me
And I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I wanted her to tell me that she would never wake me
I'm lying here waiting for sleep to overtake me",

    "Your hand on his arm
Haystack charm around your neck
Strung out and thin
Calling some friend tryin' to cash some check
He's acting dumb
That's what you've come to expect
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
He's wearing your clothes
Head down to toes a reaction to you
You say you know what he did
But you idiot kid, you don't have a clue
Sometimes they just get caught in the eye
You're pulling him through
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Now on the bus
Nearly touching this dirty retreat
Falling out
6th and Powell, a dead sweat in my teeth
Gonna walk, walk, walk
Four more blocks, plus the one in my brain
Down downstairs
To the man, he's gonna make it all okay
I can't be myself
I can't be myself and I don't wanna talk
I'm taking the cure
So I can be quiet whenever I want
So leave me alone
You oughta be proud that I'm getting good marks
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay
Needle in the hay",
    "No bad dream fucker's gonna boss me around
Christian brothers gonna take him down
But it can't help me get over
Don't be cross, this sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Fake concerns is what's the matter, man
And you think I ought to shake your motherfucking hand
Well I know how much you care
Don't be cross, this sick I want
I've seen the boss blink on and off
Come here by me I want you here
Nightmares become me it's so fucking clear
Nightmares become me it's so fucking clear",
    "They're waking you up to close the bar
The street's wet, you can tell by the sound of the cars
The bartender's singing Clementine
While hes turning around the open sign
Dreadful sorry, Clementine
Though youre still her man
It seems a long time gone
Maybe the whole thing's wrong
What if she thinks so and just didn't say so?
You drank yourself into slow-mo
Made an angel in the snow
Anything to pass the time
And keep that song out of your mind
Oh, my darling
Oh, my darling
Oh, my darling, Clementine
Dreadful sorry, Clementine
Dreadful sorry, Clementine",
    "Killing a southern belle is all you know how to do
That and give other people hell
It's what they expect from you too
But I wouldn't have you how you want
I don't want to walk around
I don't even want to breathe
I live in a southern town
Where all you can do is grit yr teeth
But I wouldn't have you how you want
How come you're not ashamed of what you are?
And sorry that you're the one she got?
Ain't nobody looking now
Nobody nothing's said
No one's about to shout
Nobody's seen red
But I wouldn't have you how you want
You're killing a southern belle
Killing a southern belle
Killing a southern belle",
    "Here in line
Where stupid shit collides
With dying shooting stars
All we got to show what we really are
Is the same kind of scars
And looking at you all I see is
You're waiting for something
Single file
You're a murder mile
You idiot kid
Your arm's got a death in it
If you're choking up take this paper cup
But there's a price you'll pay
For trying hard to become whatever they are
And saying whatever they say
So help yourself to this bitter pill
Or somebody else will
Single file
You're a murder mile
You idiot kid
Your arm's got a death in it
Single file",
    " I'm a junkyard full of false starts
And I don't need your permission
To bury my love under this bare light bulb
The moon is a sickle cell
It'll kill you in time
Your cold white brother will ride in your blood
Like spun glass in sore eyes
While the moon does its division
You're buried below
And you're coming up roses everywhere you go
Red roses follow
The things that you tell yourself
They'll kill you in time
Your cold white brother alive in your blood
Spinning in the night sky
While the moon does its division
You're buried below
And you're coming up roses everywhere you go
Red roses
So you got in a kind of trouble that nobody knows
It's coming up roses everywhere you go
Red roses",
    "While the hands are pointing up midnight
You're a question mark coming after people you watched collide
You can ask what you want to the satellite
'Cause the names you drop put ice in my veins
And for all you know you're the only one who finds it strange
When they call it a lover's moon
The satellite
'Cause it acts just like lovers do
The satellite
A burned out world you know
Staying up all night
The satellite",
    "Alphabet City is haunted
Constantina feels right at home
She probably won't say you're wrong
But you're already wrong
You're already wrong
And you threw up whatever she shot down
Said, show me around this alphabet town
Said, show me around
There's a name you keep repeating
You got nothing better to do
And you're with someone who'll hear you say it and just not mind
Her hand on your arm, her hand on your arm
She put her hand on your arm
And told you her name you can't pronounce it
I'll show you around this alphabet town
I'll show you around this alphabet town
I know what you are
I just don't mind
I won't say you're wrong
I know what you want
And it's what I want
So let's go out, I'm ready to go out
I'll show you around this alphabet town",
    "Everything is exactly right
When I walk around here drunk every night
With an open container from 7-Eleven
In St. Ides Heaven
I've been out haunting the neighborhood
And everybody can see I'm no good
When I'm walking out between parked cars
With my head full of stars
High on amphetamines
The moon is a light bulb breaking
It'll go around with anyone
But it won't come down for anyone
You think you know what brings me down
That I want those things you could never allow
You see me smiling, you think it's a frown
Turned upside down
'Cause everyone is a fucking pro
And they all got answers from trouble they've known
And they all got to say what you should and shouldn't do
Though they don't have a clue
High on amphetamines
The moon is a light bulb breaking
It'll go around with anyone
But it won't come down for anyone
And I won't come down for anyone",
    "A low riding junkie girl
Rode down south to yr little world like a dream
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to be like me
I wouldn't need a hero if I wasn't such a zero
If I wasn't such a zero
Good to go
All I ever see around here is things of hers that you left lying around
It's all I ever see around here
She kicked new york like a curse
And you traced her footsteps in reverse up to queens
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to
You can do it if you want to be like me
I wouldn't need a hero if I wasn't such a zero
If I wasn't such a zero
Good to go
All I ever see around here is things of hers that you left lying around
It's all I ever see around here
Some empty envelopes from some other town
It's all I ever see around here
I'm waiting for something that's not coming",
    "Keep your things in a place meant to hide
But I know they're there somewhere
And I know that's where you'll go tonight
I'll be thrown over just like before
The white lady loves you more
Need a metal man just to pick up your feet
It's a long time since you cared enough for me to even be discrete
I know what this metal is for
The white lady loves you more
I'm looking at a hand full of broken plans
And I'm tired of playing it down
You just want her to do anything for you
There ain't nothing that you won't allow
You wake up in the middle of the night
From a dream you won't remember flashing on like a cop's light
You say she's waiting and I know what for
The white lady loves you more",
    "I'm waiting for the train
The subway that only goes one way
The stupid thing that'll come to pull us apart
And make everybody late
You spent everything you had
Wanted everything to stop that bad
And now I'm a crushed credit card registered to Smith
Not the name that you call me with
You turned white like a saint
I'm tired of dancing on a pot of gold-flaked paint
Oh, we're so very precious, you and I
And everything that you do makes me want to die
Oh, I just told the biggest lie
I just told the biggest lie
The biggest lie",

    # Either/Or (12)
    "He's pleased to meet you underneath the horse
In the cathedral with the glass stained black
Singing sweet, high notes that echo back
To destroy their master
May be a long time 'til you get the call-up
But it's sure as fate and hard as your luck
No one'll know where you are
It's just a brief smile
Crossing your face
I'm running speed trials
Standing in place
When the socket's not a shock enough
You little child, what makes you think you're tough?
When all the people you think you're above
They all know what's the matter
You're such a pinball, yeah, you know it's true
There's always something you go back running to
To follow the path of no resistance
It's just a brief smile
Crossing your face
I'm running speed trials
Standing in place
It's just a brief smile
Crossing your face
I'm running speed trials
All over the place",
    "You walk down Alameda
Shuffling your deck of trick cards over everyone
Like some precious only son
Face down, bow to the champion
You walk down Alameda
Looking at the cracks in the sidewalk
Thinking about your friends
How you maintain all them in
A constant state of suspense
For your own protection over their affection
Nobody broke your heart
You broke your own 'cause you can't finish what you start
Walk down Alameda
Brushing off the nightmares
You wish could plague me when I'm awake
So now you see your first mistake
Was thinking that you could relate
For one or two minutes, she liked you
But the fix is in
You're all pretension, I never pay attention
Nobody broke your heart
You broke your own 'cause you can't finish what you start
Nobody broke your heart
You broke your own 'cause you can't finish what you start
Nobody broke your heart
You broke your own 'cause you can't finish what you start
Nobody broke your heart
If you're alone, it must be you that wants to be apart",
    "Throwing candy out to the crowd
Dragging down the main
The helpless little thing with the dirty mouth
Who's always got something to say
You're sitting around at home now waiting for your brother to call
I saw him down in the alley
Having had enough of it all
Said you can do what you want to whenever you want to
You can do what you want to there's no one to stop you
All spit and spite you're up all night and down every day
A tired man with only hours to go just waiting to be taken away
Getting into the back of a car for candy from some stranger
Watching the parade with pinpoint eyes full of smoldering anger
You can do what you want to whenever you want to
You can do what you want to there's no one to stop you
Now you can do what you want to whenever you want to
Do what you want to whenever you want to
Do what you want to whenever you want to
Though it doesn't mean a thing
Big nothing",
 "Drink up, baby, stay up all night
With the things you could do, you won't but you might
The potential you'll be that you'll never see
The promises you'll only make
Drink up with me now and forget all about
The pressure of days, do what I say
And I'll make you okay and drive them away
The images stuck in your head
People you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still
Drink up, baby, look at the stars
I'll kiss you again between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there with your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest where I like you the best
And keep the things you forgot",
    "Start stop and start
Stupid acting smart
Flirting with the flicks
You say it's just for kicks
You'll be the victim of your own dirty tricks
You got yourself to tease and displease
Doors swinging wide
You walked in to hide
Looking at your feet
Failure's complete
Saw you and me on the coin-op tv
Frozen in fear every time we appear
I'm not surprised and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong
Totally wrong
Go walking by
Here come another guy
Jailer who sells personal hells
Who'd like to see me down on my fucking knees
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
Hey hey hey hey
I'm not surprised and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Completely wrong
Totally wrong
I'm not surprised and really, why should I be?
See nothing wrong
See nothing wrong
So sick and tired of all these pictures of me
Oh everybody's dying just to get the disease
Everybody's dying just to get the disease
Everybody's dying just to get the disease",
    "Got bitten fingernails and a head full of the past
And everybody's gone at last
Sweet, sweet smile that's fading fast
'Cause everybody's gone at last
Don't get upset about it, no, not anymore
There's nothing wrong that wasn't wrong before
Had a second alone with a chance let pass
And everybody's gone at last
I hope you're not waiting, waiting 'round for me
'Cause I'm not going anywhere, obviously
Got a broken heart and your name on my cast
And everybody's gone at last
Everybody's gone at last",
    "You asked me to come down and watch the parade
To march down the street like the Duracell bunny
With a wink and a wave from the cavalcade
Throwing out candy that looks like money
To people passing by that all seem to be going the other way
Said, Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?
Tripped over a dog in a choke-chain collar
People were shouting and pushing and saying
And I traded a smoke for a food stamp dollar
Ridiculous marching band started playing
Got me singing along with some half-hearted victory song
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?
Won't you follow me down to the Rose Parade?",
    "A wallflower Punch
Talks to Judy
In a crowded corner where
Anybody can listen in
But they don't read page to page
Or speak easy
Now, they're gonna go say the words
In the wrong order again
They walk in a circle
Through all the sidewalk scenes
That they used to be a part of one time
Now, everybody just stares and whispers
Driving around
Up and down Division Street
I used to like it here
It just bums me out to remember
Can't you ever treat anyone nice?
Think I'm gonna make the same mistake twice, oh
They draw the curtain
Wait for a call
Pretty lucky if they get
Any kind of response at all",

Trailing some new kill
Says I've seen your picture on a
Hundred-dollar bill
What's a game of chance to you
To him is one
Of real skill
So glad to meet you, Angeles
Picking up the ticket shows there's
Money to be made
Go on, lose the gamble that's the
History of the trade
Did you add up all the cards left to play
To zero?
And sign up with evil, Angeles?
Don't start me trying now
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
'Cause I'm all over it, Angeles
I can make you satisfied in
Everything you do
All your secret wishes could right
Now be coming true
And be forever with my poison arms
Around you
No one's gonna fool around with us
No one's gonna fool around with us
So glad to meet you, Angeles",

Where mute memories start talking
The boss that couldn't help but hurt you
And the pretty thing you made desert you
I'm going out like a baby
A naive, unsatisfiable baby
Grabbin' onto whatever's around
For the soaring high or the crushing down
With hidden cracks that don't show
But that constantly just grow
I'm lookin' for the man that attacked me
While everybody was laughin' at me
You beat it in me, that part of you
But I'm gonna split us back in two
Tired of livin' in a cloud
If you're gonna say shit now, you'll do it out loud
It's 2:45 in the morning
And I'm putting myself on warning
For waking up in an unknown place
With a recollection you half-erased
Lookin' for somebody's arms
To wave away past harms
walking out on center circle
The both of you can just fade to black
I'm walking out on center circle
Been pushed away and I'll never go back",
    "I'm in love with the world
Through the eyes of a girl
Who's still around the morning after
We broke up a month ago
And I grew up, I didn't know
I'd be around the morning after
It's always been wait and see
A happy day and then you pay
And feel like shit the morning after
But now I feel changed around
And instead of falling down
I'm standing up the morning after
Situations get fucked up
And turned around sooner or later
I could be another fool
Or an exception to the rule
You tell me the morning after
Crooked spin can't come to rest
I'm damaged bad at best
She'll decide what she wants
I'll probably be the last to know
No one says until it shows, see how it is
They want you or they don't
Say yes
I'm in love with the world
Through the eyes of a girl
Who's still around the morning after",
    # From a Basement on the Hill (15)
    "Last stop for a resolution
End of the line, is it confusion?
So go, go see what's there for you
Nothing new, nothing new for you to use
I've got no new act to amuse you
I've got no desire to use you, you know
But anything that I could do, would never be good enough for you
If you can't help it then just leave it alone
Leave it alone, yeah, just forget it
It's really easy
I believe I'll forget it too
Still you're keepin' me around
Til I finally drag us both down
Streaming feathers out your hat
Yes I believe that's where it's at
You belong tagging along
And I belong in your zoo
So I wait for confirmation
That you're never gonna use your starting gun
Unless its me it sounds like being here just wasn't that much fun
Anything that I could do
Would never be good enough for you
If you can't help it then just leave it alone
Leave me alone, yeah, just forget it
It's really easy
I'll just forget it too
Coast to coast, coast to coast
I'll do what I can so you can be what you do
Coast to coast, coast to coast
I'll do everything I can so you can be what you do
Coast to coast, coast to coast
Circuit rider comes every fifth Sunday
Oh my Lord, I fell asleep one day
Anything that I could do
Is there anything that I could do
That someone doesn't do for you
That someone didn't do for you
That I haven't already done for you",
    "I'd been outside, invited in
But I couldn't abide, I went missing again
Burning every bridge that I cross
To find some beautiful place to get lost
I had true love, I made it die
I pushed her away, she said, Please, stay
Burning every bridge that I cross
To find some beautiful place to get lost
To find some beautiful place to get lost, ooh
Well, I dont know where I'll go now
And I dont really care who follows me there
But I'll burn every bridge that I cross
And find some beautiful place to get lost
And find some beautiful place to get lost, ooh",
    "Sunshine
Been keeping me up for days
There is no nighttime
It's only a passing phase
And I feel pretty
Pretty enough for you
I felt so ugly before
I didn't know what to do
Sometimes
Is all I feel up to now
But it's not worth it to you
'Cause you gotta get high somehow
Is it destruction that you require to feel?
Like somebody wants you
Someone that's more for real
Sunshine
Been keeping me up for days
There is no nighttime
Only a passing phase
And I'll feel pretty
Another hour or two
I felt so ugly before (ugly before)
I didn't know what to do
I felt so ugly before (ugly before)
I didn't know what to do
I felt so ugly before (ugly before)
I didn't know what to do
Ugly before (ugly before)
Ohh",
    "I met a girl
Snowball in hell
She was scarred
And as cracked as the Liberty Bell
I got her to
Come on, move in with me
And I said I'd find a better place
We can spend eternity
But don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay
Her momma called me a thief
And her dad
Called himself Commander in Chief
I fought him off with my love
But I knew the sense of worthlessness
She'd have to rise above
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay
She had a dream
Woke up in shock
She had seen her own body
Outlined in chalk
And I split the scene
The globe's been spun
And her ghost beamed down to kiss me
With a message from the sun
Don't go down
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay
Don't go down
Stay with me, baby stay
Don't go down
 stay with me, baby stay",
    "You get what you see
I saw a rich fuck giving charity
Saw an evil emperor
Wearing my clothes
They're far from the best
But they might suit you better than the rest
Just looking in the mirror
Will make you a brave man
I know my place
Hate my face
I know how I begin
And how I'll end
Strung out again
Was a parliament of owls
Fly over a city of canals
Floating on the body
Floating in the Dalles
You get what you see
But some things they just change invisibly
I don't know where I'm going
And I don't even want to know
They're far from the best
But they might suit you better than the rest
Just looking in the mirror
Will make you a brave man
Standing, smiling
On some fantasy island
Looking at my lost reflection again
But a tide's coming in
And I'm strung out again
Strung out again",
    "The litebrite's now black and white
Cause you took apart a picture that wasn't right
Pitch burning on a shining sheet
The only maker that you'd want to meet
The dying man in a living room
Who's shadow paces the floor
Who'll take you out in the open door
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
Who couldn't get things right
Fond farewell to a friend
He said really I just want to dance
Good and evil matched perfect it's a great romance
I can deal with some physic pain
If it'll slow down my higher brain
Veins full of disappearing ink
Vomiting in the kitchen sink
Disconnecting from the missing link
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
Who couldn't get things right
Fond farewell to a friend
I see you're leaving me and taking up with the enemy
The cold comfort of the in between
A little less than a human being
A little less than a happy high
A little less than a suicide
The only things that you really tried
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
Who couldn't get things right
Fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend",
    "The King's crossing was the main attraction
Dominoes falling in a chain reaction
The scraping subject ruled by fear told me
Whiskey works better than beer
The judge is on vinyl, decisions are final
And nobody gets a reprieve
And every wave is tidal
If you hang around you're going to get wet
I can't prepare for death any more than I already have
All you can do now is watch the shells
The game looks easy that's why it sells
Frustrated fireworks inside your head
Are going to stand and deliver talk instead
The method acting that pays my bills
Keeps the fat man feeding in Beverly Hills
I got a heavy metal mouth, it hurls obscenity
And I get my check from the trash treasury
Because I took my own insides out
It don't matter 'cause I have no sex life
And all I wanna do now is inject my ex-wife
I've seen the movie
And I know what happens
It's Christmas time
And the needles on the tree
A skinny Santa is bringing something to me
His voice is overwhelming
But his speech is slurred
And I only understand every other word
Open your parachute and grab your gun
Falling down like an omen, a setting sun
Read the part and return at five
It's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive
But I don't care if I fuck up
I'm going on a date
With a rich wife lady
Ain't life great?
Give me one good reason not to do it
(Because we love you)
So do it
This is the place where time reverses
And dead men talk to all the pretty nurses
Instruments shine on a silver tray
Don't let me get carried away
Don't let me get carried away
Don't let me be carried away",
    "NA",
    "Haven't laughed this hard in a long time
I better stop now before I start crying
Go off to sleep in the sunshine
I don't want to see the day when it's dying
She's a sight to see (sight to see)
She's good to me (good to me)
But I'm already somebody's baby
She's a pretty thing (a pretty thing)
And she knows everything (everything)
But I'm already somebody's baby
You don't deserve to be lonely
But those drugs you got won't make you feel better
Pretty soon, you'll find it's the only
Little part of your life you're keeping together
I'm nice to you (nice to you)
I could make it through (make it through)
But you're already somebody's baby
I could make you smile (make you smile)
If you stayed a while (stayed a while)
But how long will you stay with me, baby?
Because your candle burns too bright
Well, I almost forgot it was twilight
Even if I think that you are right
Well, I'm tired of being down, I got no fight
You're wonderful (wonderful)
And it's beautiful (beautiful)
But I'm already somebody's baby
And if I went with you (went with you)
I'd disappoint you too (disappoint you too)
Well, I'm already somebody's baby
Already somebody's baby",
    "Everything is gone but the echo of the burst of the shell
And I'm stuck here waiting
For a passing feeling
In the city I built up and blew to hell
I'm stuck here waiting
For a passing feeling
Still I send all the time
My request for relief
Down the dead power line
Though I'm beyond belief
In the help I require
Just to exist at all
Took a long time to stand
Took an hour to fall
I'm stuck here waiting
For a passing feeling
Stuck here waiting
For a passing feeling
 Still I send all the time
My request for relief
Down the dead power line
Though I'm beyond belief
In the help I require
Just to exist at all
Took a long time to stand
Took an hour to fall",
    "Here's the army that you mowed to the ground
And the bodies you left lying around
Talking it out
The last hour
I'm through trying now
It's a big relief
I'll be staying down
Where no one else gonna give me grief
Mess me around
Just make it over
Your opinion was the law of the land
The single thing that I could always understand
I lived it out from hour to hour
The only thing that never really changed
You ran me all around
And dragged me down
At the end of the day
Don't keep me around
Just make it over
 [Verse 1]
Here's the army that you mowed to the ground
And the bodies you left lying around
Talking it out
The last hour
I'm through trying now
It's a big relief
I'll be staying down
Where no one else gonna give me grief

[Chorus 1]
Mess me around
Just make it over
Your opinion was the law of the land
The single thing that I could always understand
I lived it out from hour to hour
The only thing that never really changed
You ran me all around
And dragged me down
At the end of the day
Don't keep me around
Just make it over",
    "You made the scene like you always do
Going up street, down the avenue
To fuck some trophy boy that you met tonight at the bar
So bad, so far
You'll make him sad
Shooting star
When it was me, I was momentarily proud
Drunk on dreams, now I'm glad I didn't say out loud
You said you'd be for real but I don't believe that you are
So bad, so far
You made me sad
Shooting star
You're distant and cold and a sight to behold
Everybody just sighs
But no one gets on with you very long
'Cause you don't feel bad when you lie
Going to sleep now, going back to find square one
Square two, beware I can deal with the shit you've just done
It won't be soon, to say the least it's gonna be hard
So bad, so far
You'll love me sad
Shooting star
You'll love me sad
Shooting star",
    "This is the place you end up
When you lose the chase
Where you're dragged against your will
From a basement on the hill
And all anybody knows
Is you're not like them
And they kick you in the head
And send you back to bed
Isolation pulled you past a tunnel to a bright
World where you can make a place to stay
But everybody's scared of this place
They're staying away
Your little house on memory lane
The mayor's name is fear
His voice patrols the pier
From a mountain of cliche
That advances every day
The doctor spoke a cloud
He rained out loud
You'll keep your doors and windows shut
And swear you'll never show a soul again
But isolation pushes you 'til every muscle aches
Down the only road it ever takes
But everybody's scared of this place
They're staying away
Your little house on memory lane
If it's your decision to be open about yourself
Be careful or else
Be careful or else
I'm comfortable apart
It's all written on my chart
That I take what's given me
Most cooperatively
I do what people say
And lie in bed all day
Absolutely horrified
I hope you're satisfied
Isolation pushes past self-hatred, guilt and shame
To a place where suffering's just a game
But everybody's scared of this place
They're staying away
Your little house on memory lane
Your little house on memory lane",
    "One more, little one
I'll go down
Stay down
Sleep the rest of the day
Dream new
Music to calm down
Stay down
And keep evil away
I can hear you asleep
Changing your shape
Dissolved in some dream
As a new one appears
To take you along
Where you've never been
One, two
Three, four, five
Six, seven
The moonlight tonight
Seems to belong to me
Cause I (Never go to sleep)
Even those who canâ€™t sleep
They need some company
 One hit
Wouldn't hurt a bit at all
Slow down (Stay down)
See whatâ€™s there to find (See whatâ€™s there today)
If it's (If itâ€™s)
Good shit you won't know (gonna be)
And I won't know (ok)
The fact that I'm dying (all done)
If I seem to be reckless with myself
It's the fault of no one
All things have a place
Under the moon
As well as the sun",
    "I'm floating in a black balloon
OD on Easter afternoon
My mama told me
Baby stay clean, theres no in between
All you ladies and you gentlemen
Between's all you've ever seen or been
Fit poorly and and arrange the sight
Doll it up in virgin white
You disappoint me
You people raking in on the world
The devil's script sells
You the heart of a blackbird
Shine on me, baby
'Cause it's raining in my heart
Sun rising on a chopping glare
Rain dropping acid blotter in the air
Distorted reality's now a necessity
To be free
So disappointing
First I put it all down to luck
God knows why my
Country don't give a fuck (fuck)
Shine on me, baby
'Cause it's raining in my heart
Shine on me, baby
'Cause it's raining in my heart"
